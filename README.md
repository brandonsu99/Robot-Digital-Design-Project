# RobotDigitalDesign
The project for the Fall 2019 semester maneuvering the DE2 bot between seven sonar reflectors scattered in a designated lab area. The DE2 bot had to find and circle as many reflectors as possible in two minutes without colliding with walls or reflectors.

Working in a team of four, my group decided to move the robot across the demo area in a straight path with small diversions to circle reflectors. We used the sensors on the right and left side of the robot to find reflectors to circle while using the sensors in front of the robot to detect potential collisions. This method allowed us to meet the specifications of the project outlined in our original proposal.
